# Working with Submdoules
run the script to create the same branch across root and all submodules:

```batch
create_branch_for_each_submodule.bat "branch_name"
```
Note that if a submodule has uncommitted changes, the git checkout command will fail. You will need to commit or discard the changes in the submodule before checking out a different branch.

To switch back to dev_win_api, use this script :
```batch
checkout_all_to_win_dev_api.bat
```
